There are two types of views in django,function based and class based. With Class base view there are two types one is Base View and other is Generic Base View.
Base Views. 
1. View 
2. TemplateView 
3. RedirectView 
We will use these views in this sample project. in simple View we can use get,post,put delete functions according to our choice as well. 

The Simple View can be used to do complete CRUD with simple  Base view like get, post,put,delete and updaet etc. The code snipet is given the views.py file 

Now the remaining View like TemplateView is used to just render the template upon request a url. We can pass context into template view via url and and render that context back to template view method of that View. The Code snipet is given in the views.py file 

Now the Third Is RedirectView which is nothing just to redirect to other view. If we want to create a view with multiple url than e can use this view which can be used to redirect to other view. the code example is given below with proper comments.
